# CarDetection
# My sample code
Program for detection objects on the road.

I have used OpenCV library (combined with STL and Boost) to test techniques I learned about image and video processing and mechine learning.
HOGDetector class uses SVM to learn and predict detections. Learnign is proceeded on histogram of oriented gradients descriptors from feeded images. In my example I used two detectors - one for cars and second for people detection, provided with OpenCV.
